Day 4 â€“ 16/06/205
Jupyter Notebooks & Virtual Environments

Today I got introduced to using Jupyter Notebooks for Python development. It was a bit challenging initially, but as I explored, I began to understand how things work better. Key learnings for the day:

Setting up and working with virtual environments

Running and writing Python code in Jupyter Notebooks

Basic I/O operations and conditionals

Introduction to NumPy and Matplotlib

Created and plotted a simple sine wave using numpy.linspace() and matplotlib.pyplot

It was a foundational step into data-focused workflows. I'm starting to see how different tools in the Python ecosystem come together.
