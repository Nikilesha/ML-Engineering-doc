Day 6 – 18/06/2025
NumPy Matrix Operations & Statistics

Today I explored more advanced operations using NumPy, focusing primarily on matrix-based statistical analysis. Here’s what I practiced:

Matrix Initialization

Generated random m x n matrices using np.random.randint()

Descriptive Statistics

Calculated:

Mean (np.mean)

Median (np.median)

Standard Deviation (np.std)

Variance (np.var)

Maximum and Minimum values (np.max, np.min)

Matrix Operations

Computed the transpose of a matrix using .T

Analyzed correlation coefficients using np.corrcoef()

Day 6 was all about getting hands-on with real data-like structures and extracting insights using NumPy’s built-in statistical tools. It was a great continuation into data analysis.
