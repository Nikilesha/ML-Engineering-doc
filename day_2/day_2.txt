Day 2 – 12/06/2025
Python OOP Basics

Today I explored the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Although it was a light day, I continued my learning streak by understanding:

How to define a class and create objects

The use of the __init__ constructor to initialize object attributes

Defining and calling methods within a class

Example concept covered:

A simple Dog class with attributes (name, age) and a method (bark())

I didn’t cover much today, but I made sure to stay consistent and kept the momentum going. Small steps count.
