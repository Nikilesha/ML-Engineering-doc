Day 3 â€“ 13/06/2025
OOP Concepts and Mini Project

Today, I continued strengthening my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming and explored some real-world applications of OOP. Key topics covered:

Class and Object Creation

Encapsulation

Usage of public, protected, and private attributes

Methods and Object Behavior

Writing class methods to interact with attributes

Banking System Simulation

Created a basic interactive banking system with PIN authentication and deposit/withdrawal functionality

Inheritance & Abstraction

Used inheritance for Student and Professor classes from a common User base class

Implemented abstract methods using the abc module

University Course Management System

Modeled a basic structure with Department, Course, Student, and Professor classes to simulate a real-world application

Day 3 was more productive and focused on applying OOP principles to build real-world inspired mini projects.
