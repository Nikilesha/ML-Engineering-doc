Python Practice Summary

Today I worked on the following Python fundamentals:

Looping constructs (for and while)

Conditional statements and logic

Basic number operations (printing, factorial, digit sum)

Prime number checking

Fibonacci series generation

String manipulation (vowel counting, character frequency)

List operations (finding max, removing duplicates, unique elements)

Dictionary operations (merging, counting frequency)

Tuple sorting using lambda functions

Type conversions (list, set, dict)

This session helped reinforce my understanding of core Python syntax and logic building.
