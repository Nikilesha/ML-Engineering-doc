Day 5 – 17/06/2025
NumPy Fundamentals

Today I focused on deepening my understanding of NumPy, one of the core libraries for numerical computing in Python. Here’s what I covered:

Array Creation and Indexing

Created 1D and 2D arrays using np.array()

Accessed and modified specific elements

Array Properties

Explored .shape, .ndim, .size, .dtype of arrays

Data Types and Type Conversion

Used dtype to enforce and inspect array data types, including handling of mixed types

Array Initialization

Learned to use np.full(), np.ones(), and np.empty() for array creation

Generating Sequences

Used np.arange() and np.linspace() for generating ranges and evenly spaced values

Special Values

Handled np.nan and np.inf, and checked for them using np.isnan() and np.isinf()

Vectorized Operations

Performed element-wise arithmetic on arrays

Compared how lists and NumPy arrays behave differently during operations

Broadcasting

Practiced broadcasting rules by adding arrays of different shapes

Mathematical Functions

Applied universal functions like np.sqrt(), np.sin(), np.cos(), and np.tan() on arrays

Today gave me hands-on experience with NumPy’s power and efficiency. Working with arrays, broadcasting, and universal functions really opened my eyes to how data science tools are structured.
